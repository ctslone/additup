# About Additup

Additup is a React.js web application developed to be a helpful tool for 2nd grade students to practice their basic addition skills. The student is preseneted with an addition equation (e.g 2 + 3 = ?) as well as an input field to type their answer. When the student clicks the submit button, the application checks the studen's answer with the correct answer computed by the Math.js API. If the student got the answer correct, the application presents them with a message saying "Great Job! You Got it Right!". If the student submits the incorrect answer, the app notifies them that their answer is incorrect and asks them to try the problem again. This web application works desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.
